# VLC-Media-Player-for-Local-RTSP-Stream
Play Local RTSP Links with a Customizable GUI


1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. python rtsp_viewer.py or python3 rtsp_viewer.py

A local host site will likely spin up on http://127.0.0.1:5000/, where the user can input RSTP Stream Link Username, Password, IP, Port, and Path to view their stream on the VLC Media Player. 

Users can then customize the background color and text.
